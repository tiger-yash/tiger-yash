I am a Full Stack Web Developer whose passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am currently enrolled in Computer Science and Engineering Programmer at the Indian Institute of Technology ( BHU ). I explore all fields of Computer Science, be it Web Development, Fun events like Capture the Flag, Machine Learning, and the sport of Competitive Programming.
